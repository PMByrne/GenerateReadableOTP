# Generate Readable OTP

`Generate Human-Readable One-Time Passwords`

**WARNING** Passwords generated by this library are *not* secure or strong and should *not* be relied upon.

Generated passwords are meant to be easily verbally communicated: (and non-offensive).

* All lower-case with no spaces.
* Word combinations shouldn't be offensive.
* No punctuation or symbols.
* Word-banks contain English words from 4th-grade (or earlier) spelling lists.

# Return Values

All methods return an array of strings.

Example: `ShortPhrase()` returns `["dogs", "like", "art"]`

This is done so that presentation-layer could format the output to maximize readability. One possibility would be alternating the colors of each word as the phrase "dogslikeart", while easy to say outloud might be cumbersome to physically read.
